Interfacing arduino uno with lcd(16*2)
# Arduino
Arduino is a microcontroller which uses atmel.Arduino is just similar atmel miccontroller but it has an extra sotware which makes it special.
They introduced a separate programming language which is mix of C and C++
So they simply made a easy process to any one to programm microcontroller
# lcd(16*2)
The one I used is 16 col and 2 row lcd
We program arduino to send data to lcd so it can print the required data in lcd
